# Regression Model for Residential Building Data Set

This repository contains the code and analysis for building a regression model using the Residential Building Data Set from the UCI dataset repository. The goal is to predict the value of residential units in Tehran.

## Dataset

The dataset can be obtained from the following website: [Residential Building Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Residential+Building+Data+Set)

## Instructions

### Q1: Regression Model

1. **Create a model with all features:** Implement a predictive model using all features from the dataset. Report the performance of your model in terms of MAE and RMSE. The target variable is V9, and V10 should be dropped.

    ```python
    # Add code snippet here
    ```

2. **Create a minimal model with 7 features:** Develop a minimal predictive model using a feature selection method of your choice. Report the performance of this minimal model in terms of MAE and RMSE. Use 10-fold cross-validation.

    ```python
    # Add code snippet here
    ```

### Submission

Please submit your code as instructed. Ensure that the code is well-documented and organized.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to run your code and any dependencies that need to be installed.

```bash
# Example commands to run the code
python regression_model_all_features.py
python regression_model_minimal_features.py
